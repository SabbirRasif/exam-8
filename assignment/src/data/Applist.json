    "description": "Forest is an app that helps you stay focused on your work. When you want to focus, you plant a seed. Over time, while you focus, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. If you leave the app, your tree will die. This gamified approach leverages the Pomodoro Technique to make deep work more engaging. Users can collectively grow a virtual forest, reinforcing the community aspect of productivity.",
